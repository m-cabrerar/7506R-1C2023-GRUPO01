      "Original: Uno de los otros críticos ha mencionado que después de ver solo 1 Oz Episodio, estará enganchado. Tienen razón, ya que esto es exactamente lo que sucedió conmigo. La primera cosa que me golpeó sobre Oz fue su brutalidad y sus escenas de violencia inconfiadas, que se encuentran a la derecha de la palabra. Confía en mí, este no es un espectáculo para los débiles de corazón o tímido. Este espectáculo no extrae punzones con respecto a las drogas, el sexo o la violencia. Es Hardcore, en el uso clásico de la palabra. Se llama OZ, ya que es el apodo dado al Penitenciario del Estado de Seguridad Máximo de Oswald. Se centra principalmente en la ciudad de Emeralda, una sección experimental de la prisión donde todas las células tienen frentes de vidrio y se enfrentan hacia adentro, por lo que la privacidad no es alta en la agenda. Em City es el hogar de muchos ... Fariarios, musulmanes, gangstas, latinos, cristianos, italianos, irlandeses y más ... así que las esposas, las miradas de muerte, las relaciones peligrosas y los acuerdos sombreados nunca están lejos. Yo diría el principal atractivo de El espectáculo se debe al hecho de que va donde otros espectáculos no se atreverían. Olvídate de las imágenes bonitas pintadas para las audiencias convencionales, olvidan el encanto, olviden el romance ... Oz no se mete. El primer episodio que he visto me sorprendió tan desagradable que fue surrealista, no podía decir que estaba listo para ello, pero cuando observé más, desarrollé un gusto por Oz, y me acostumbré a los altos niveles de violencia gráfica. No solo la violencia, sino la injusticia (Guardias torcidas que se vendrán por un níquel, los reclusos que se matarán en orden y se alejarán con él, de manera educada, los reclusos de clase media se convirtieron en perras de la prisión debido a su falta de habilidades callejeras O experiencia en la prisión) viendo oz, puede sentirse cómodo con lo que es incómodo visualización ... eso es si puedes ponerte en contacto con tu lado más oscuro.\n",
